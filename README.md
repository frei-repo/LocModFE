# LocModFE
This source code contains an implementation of the locally modified finite element method first proposed  by S. Frei, T. Richter, SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis 52 (5), 2315-2334. This method is a simple approach to solve interface problems, as arising in fluid-structure-interactions or multi-phase flows, or problems on complex boundaries.
